    <p>Shawarma, originating from the Ottoman Empire, is a very popular street food item from the Middle East,
         made from marinated meats such as lamb, beef or chicken, slow-roasted on a vertical spit, basting in its own juices, and thinly sliced.
         Shawarma is often times wrapped in pita or served over rice.</p>
